Please read me first

A file named vpn_topo.log recorded some connection information between hosts.
e.g.	
        a->b,
        b->c,
        c->d,
        c->a,
        a->b, etc.
a and b represents a hostname respectively, a->b mean the connection line is
from a to b.

Problem:
Find the largest two number of connection of host and print them out.
Note that the same connection will not be counted more than once. For example,
a->b, a->b will be counted as "a->b".
So for the samples above, the right output should be
c 3
a 2
